### What is an Automated Market Maker ?

An Automated Market Maker is a system for exchanging assets which was popularized first by Uniswap and differs from traditional exchange systems in a few fundamental ways.

AMM's have two types of users :

#### Liquidity Providers
Liquidity Providers (LP's) earn fees by depositing liquidity (both assets of a trading pair in equal value) to a pair's liquidity pool.

#### Market Participants
Market Participants buy and sell assets in the market, their experience is identical to that of a traditional exchange user.

### How can I get RSWP?
RSWP will be distributed by staking Mainnet TAU on Launch Date (23th March 2021). This staking pool will be live indefinitely.

Shortly afterwards, the RSWP/TAU LP farming pool will be opened, providing a higher RSWP reward to compensate for the unfortunate realities of impermanent loss.
