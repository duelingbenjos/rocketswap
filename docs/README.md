### What is Rocketswap ?

[Rocketswap](https://rocketswap.exchange) is a community developed AMM (Automated Market Maker) which resides on the [Lamden Blockchain](https://www.lamden.io).

The Rocketswap application can be found here @ https://rocketswap.exchange

### What is an Automated Market Maker ?

An Automated Market Maker is a system for exchanging assets which was popularized first by Uniswap and differs from traditional exchange systems in a few fundamental ways.

AMM's have two types of users :

#### Liquidity Providers
Liquidity Providers (LP's) earn fees by depositing liquidity (both assets of a trading pair in equal value) to a pair's liquidity pool.

#### Market Participants
Market Participants buy and sell assets in the market, their experience is identical to that of a traditional exchange user.

### The Team

We are a small team of engineers, with 40+ years of experience, committed to pushing the envelope of what is possible in the blockchain space, delivering value to the ecosystem as a whole and to our users.
We built Rocketswap to strengthen and foster a growing Lamden ecosystem. 

Rocketswap will achieve this goal by creating positive feedback loops across projects, allowing all Lamden assets to find fair market value.

### How can I get RSWP?
RSWP will be distributed by staking Mainnet TAU on Launch Date (23th March 2021). This staking pool will be live indefinitely.

Shortly afterwards, the RSWP/TAU LP farming pool will be opened, providing a higher RSWP reward to compensate for the unfortunate realities of impermanent loss.
